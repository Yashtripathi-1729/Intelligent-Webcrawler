IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES

All passengers (Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-term Pass Holders and Foreign Visitors) who would like to enter Singapore are required to submit the **electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC) via the**[**SG Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service**](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard) before clearing immigration.

Please note that the paper-based disembarkation and embarkation card for arriving foreign visitors has been discontinued with effect from 27 March 2020. Foreign visitors will instead provide their arrival information via the SGAC e-Service instead.

In addition to the submission of the eHDC, Long-term Pass Holders and Foreign Visitors are also required to have their passports and Permits / Entry Visas (if applicable) ready as well . If you are arriving within six days of passing through areas endemic for Yellow Fever, you may need to present a Fever Vaccination Certificate.

Instructions for Submission of electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC)

You may submit the eHDC and SGAC via the SGAC e-Service at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard>, or via the myICA Mobile app which can be downloaded by scanning the QR code below:

AUTOMATED CLEARANCE SYSTEM

All travellers must submit their SG Arrival Card (SGAC) within three days before arrival. Submission of the SG Arrival Card (SGAC) is free of charge and should only be done via ICA’s official channels ([ICA's SGAC e-Service](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard/) or [MyICA](https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/myica-mobile)[ Mobile app](https://www.ica.gov.sg/public-education/myica-mobile)).
