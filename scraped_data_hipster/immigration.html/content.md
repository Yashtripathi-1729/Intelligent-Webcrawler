IMMIGRATION PROCEDURES

All passengers (Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents, Long-term Pass Holders and Foreign Visitors) who would like to enter Singapore are required to submit the **electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC) via the**[**SG Arrival Card (SGAC) e-Service**](https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard) before clearing immigration.

Please note that the paper-based disembarkation and embarkation card for arriving foreign visitors has been discontinued with effect from 27 March 2020. Foreign visitors will instead provide their arrival information via the SGAC e-Service instead.

In addition to the submission of the eHDC, Long-term Pass Holders and Foreign Visitors are also required to have their passports and Permits / Entry Visas (if applicable) ready as well . If you are arriving within six days of passing through areas endemic for Yellow Fever, you may need to present a Fever Vaccination Certificate.

Instructions for Submission of electronic Health Declaration Card (eHDC)

You may submit the eHDC and SGAC via the SGAC e-Service at <https://eservices.ica.gov.sg/sgarrivalcard>, or via the myICA Mobile app which can be downloaded by scanning the QR code below:
